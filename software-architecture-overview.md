# Software Architectural Overview

This documents the decisions made concerning the tools and construction of the fitboard system. It does not document how these tools
function. This document is broken down based on needs of the system.

#

### Breakdown

System goal: Pressing a button on the Fitboard result in an action in the game.

Requirements Breakdown:

- Button hardware must be recognized by 

#

**Need:** 

**Requirement:** Fitboard button press -> computer input

**Decision:** Arduino `// @NickSullivan more info needed`

- The Arduino is easily programmable (and reprogrammable)
- Low Cost
- Team already had experience for pursuing this option

#

**Need:** Application and Games for a user to 

**Need: Computer recognition of Arduino input**

**Decision:** Custom Arduino Driver
