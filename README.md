# FITBoard Documentation

The FITBoard (also "fitboard") project is designed to make physical therapy more fun, adaptable, and measurable.

**For Patients:** The target users of the fitboard are children. For children, the fitboard presents a fun gaming interface for the entire body. Children can use their hands, feet, and heads to interact with many games.

**For Therapists:** The fitboard app allows the therapist with a way to turn exercises into fun. The app provides a fitboard configuration screen which allows the therapist to configure the buttons to best suit the current therapy exercise as well as metrics to follow a patient's progress.

The documentation for this system is provided below:
